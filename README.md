Holon programming was a conceptual paradigm developed in the early 1970's by Pierre-Arnoul de Marneffe. 
Its purpose was to give programmers a way to write "structured programs" using mostly natural language
descriptions (or even ideograms!) that would be replaced by blocks of executable code via a "synthesizer." 
This idea inspired Donald Knuth to create [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

In 1973, de Marneffe wrote a document describing holon programming and privately circulated it among
computer scientists. This document thereafter became a Borgesian mythical book, existing only in citations
by Knuth. But kind librarians sent the one extant copy across the ocean so that it could be typeset and
finally assume a real form!

This repository contains de Marneffe's long-lost *Holon Programming: A Survey*, prefaced by a 1974 letter 
from Knuth to the author. Please send any bugs or suggestions to the email address found in the endnote.
